### What is pre-commit hook?

Pre-commit hook is a command that is going to be run every time you commit a file to git.
 
If pre-commit hook fails, then commit aborts.

Usually you would like to run `linters` and `code-formatters` on every staged file to ensure code quality in your project

Check out [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#readme). It works really well with `simple-pre-commit`

You can look up about git hooks on [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

### When to use it

`simple-pre-commit` works well for small-sized projects when you need quickly setup `pre-commit` hook with one or a few commands and forget about it. 

However, this package only allows you to set the `pre-commit` hook. If you need, for example `pre-push` hook or something else — this package wouln't be able to help you

Also, this package requires you to manually update the `pre-commit` hook. If you want update `pre-commit` hook often - this is probably not the best choice 

If you need multiple hooks, flexible configuration or git hook automatic update feature — please check out other packages:

* [husky](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook)
* [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)


## Usage

### Add pre-commit hook to the project:

1. Install the simple-pre-commit as dev dependency 
   
   ```sh
   npm install simple-pre-commit --save-dev
   ```

2. Add the `simple-pre-commit` to your `package.json`. Feed it with any command you would like to run as a `pre-commit` hook.
   
   ```json
     "simple-pre-commit": "npx lint-staged"`
   ```

   > There are more ways to configure the package. Check out [additional configuration](#Additional configuration options)

3. Run the CLI script to update the git hook with command from `package.json`

   ```sh
   npx simple-pre-commit
   ```
    
Now the command from `package.json` is set up as executable git `pre-commit` hook. 

### Update a pre-commit hook command

Run `npx simple-pre-commit` **from root of your project**

Note that you should manually run `npx simple-pre-commit` **every time you change the command**


### Additional configuration options

You can also add the `.simple-pre-commit.json` to the project and write the command inside it, if you do not want to put command inside `package.json`

That way, `.simple-pre-commit.json` should look like this and `package.json` may not have `simple-pre-commit` configuration inside it

```json
{ 
    "simple-pre-commit":"npx lint staged"
}
```
